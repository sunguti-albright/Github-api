# GithubApi


## By Sunguti Albright

### Description
<p>This site uses the Github api to search for developers on Github and showcase their repositories.</p>

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

### Requirements
 
 * Either a computer,phone,tablet or an Ipad with storage space.
 
 * An access to the Internet since the web page is hosted on an online server
 * Have Chrome or any other web browser installed on your device.

  ### Installation Process
 
 * First, the user must have a text editor installed on their electronic device. common text editors include atom and Visual studio code.
 * Have a github account, navigate to my repositories and copy the repository link.
 * Use git init command on your terminal to initiate an empty repo in your files.
 * Clone the repository by using "git clone + pasted link". This will make all the remote repository files available locally on your machine.
 * Open the files using the code editor
 *  Run the code to display the output on the web browser.

 ## Technology Used
 * HTML - which was used to build the structure of the pages
 
 * CSS - which was used to style the pages incuding the left aside navigation bar and image styling

 * Bootstrap - which i used to add rows and columns to the page

 * Javascript - to add functionality to the web page

 * Angular - to add functionality to the page through components 

 * TypeScript - for specification of data and object properties and types

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
